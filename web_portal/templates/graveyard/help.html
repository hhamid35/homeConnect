							<h3>Setting up and using your STATCLAVE G4 web portal</h3>
							<p>This web portal is a direct connection to the STATCLAVE on your network. It is protected by your firewall and not accessible to outside users. It provides real-time cycle information and archived sterilization records unique to this unit. From here, you can print reports, set up email notification and search cycle histories. To set up your web portal follow these instructions.  </p>
							<h4>Connecting to a Network</h4>
							<p>The STATCLAVE G4 has a 10/100Base-T Ethernet port located at the back of the unit. To connect your STATCLAVE to a network using a router, follow these steps:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>Connect your network cable to the Ethernet port at the back of the unit. If your office uses a router, the router should automatically assign the unit an IP address. You will know the IP address has been assigned when the red X over the Network icon disappears.   </p>
									<p>
										<b>NOTE: </b>In some circumstances, for example, where you do not have a router and when using Windows Network Sharing, you may have to assign a dedicated or ‘static’ IP address. To assign a static IP address, contact your local network administrator.    
									</p></li>
								<li>From the main screen, press the NETWORKING icon. The Networking screen displays information about your STATCLAVE’s connectivity, including its IP address.     </li>
								<li>Type the IP address displayed on the touchscreen into your computer’s browser to access your unit’s web portal. You will know that an IP address has been assigned when the red X over the Network icon disappears. When the Network icon is active (for example when sending email) it will turn green.   </li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								<b>NOTE: </b>Connection time will vary depending on your network speed, and making an initial connection may take longer.     
							</p>
							<h4>Connecting your STATCLAVE G4 to a wireless network</h4>
							<p>The STATCLAVE G4 can be configured for wireless use by connecting the Ethernet port to an external wireless bridge / access point. SciCan currently recommends the use of the D-Link® DAP-1522 Xtreme N® Duo Wireless Bridge. Contact your network administrator to learn more about setting up a wireless bridge.   </p>
							<h4>Reserving an IP Address for Your STATCLAVE</h4>
							<p>When your STATCLAVE is connected to a router on your network, it is assigned a unique IP address.</p>
							<p>
								<b>NOTE: </b>Accessing this screen will vary for each router, please consult your router’s User Manual or contact your network administrator for more detailed instructions. SciCan currently recommends D-Link DIR-615 Wireless N router.    
							</p>
							<p>If the connection between your STATCLAVE and the router is lost (ie. facility lost power, STATCLAVE or router was restarted, etc), then the re-established connection may be a different IP address. This may result in invalid links from any previously saved bookmarks or other saved connections. In order to set a ‘permanent’ IP address, follow these steps to establish a ‘DHCP/IP/Address Reservation’:  </p>
							<p>
								<b>NOTE: </b>Each manufacturer may use different nomenclature, this settings may be called one of the following:     
								<ul>
									<li>DHCP Reservation,</li>
									<li>IP Reservation, or</li>
									<li>Address Reservation.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>IMPORTANT: </b>Please contact your network administrator for more detailed instructions.     
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>On the STATCLAVE unit LCD, select the network information button and write down the numbers found for the GATE (Router Local IP).     </li>
								<li><p>Use this GATE address in any web browser to access your router settings.</p>
									<p>
										<b>NOTE: </b>You will need your network password to change the settings.
									</p></li>
								<li>Use the ‘DHCP/IP/Address Reservation’ function to assign a ‘permanent’ IP address to your STATCLAVE. You will have to select the appropriate device to apply this setting, your unit’s default name will be: ‘STATCLAVE_###’    </li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Setting up your CONTACTS page</h4>
							<p>The Contacts page is the dental office profile, where location and contact information are inputted.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Click on the SETUP page and go to the CONTACTS tab.</li>
								<li>Here you will be prompted to provide a user name and password. For both the user name and password, the default is “scican”. Use it to enter and then you can customize it using the PASSWORD tab.    </li>
								<li>Fill in the fields such as Office Name, Office Phone, Address and email.</li>
								<li>Your Dealer can input their name, phone number and email under the Dealer section. </li>
								<li>You can also add your Dealer or SciCan Sales representative’s information under the Sales Representative section.</li>
								<li>Upload your office logo, by clicking on ‘Choose File’. This logo will appear in the web portal and also on any print outs. The upload will accept any image file formats and will automatically re-size to fit.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								<b>NOTE: </b>Please read and review SciCan’s privacy statement. Refer to SciCan’s website if you cannot access the statement through the Web Portal. To accept the statement, check the box - your STATCLAVE cannot send any emails if the box is unchecked.    
							</p>
							<h4>Setting up your LAN page</h4>
							<p>The Local Area Network (or LAN) page is where you tell the G4 how to connect to the internet. In most cases, the router will automatically assign an IP to the G4 – which means you should leave the Automatic IP box checked.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>From the SETUP page, use the LAN tab to check your network settings.</li>
								<li>The Device Name can be modified to be an identifier for that specific unit (for example, STATCLAVE_Assistant). It is important to note that the name must not have any spaces, hyphens or underscores can be used as space holders. The device name will be applied on the homepage as well. In offices that have multiple G4 units on the network, this makes it easier to identify each unit individually.</li>
								<li>If you have a router in your office, keep the Automatic IP box checked. This will populate the fields for correct network settings automatically.     </li>
								<li>If you want to assign different values to these fields, uncheck the box, populate the fields and click Save to preserve the changes.     </li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Setting up who will receive email NOTIFICATIONS</h4>
							<p>This is where you tell your G4 who should receive emails and which emails they will receive. You can decide if the recipient will receive an email every time the unit runs a cycle or only when there is a cycle fault.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>From the SETUP page, go to the NOTIFICATIONS tab.</li>
								<li>Enter the email addresses that were defined before we started. For each address you can check the ‘CF’ checkbox for cycle fault only or ‘All’ for all cycles. It would be a good idea to create an artificial email account with one of the free email providers (ie. Gmail, Hotmail, etc.) as one of the recipient who receives ‘All’ emails. This would then be an off-site storage of all cycles in the inbox, accessible anytime it is needed.</li>
								<li>The message box lets you add details which will append to all the emails sent.</li>
								<li>Enable ‘End of Sterilization Notification’ to receive email alerts before the air drying phase begins. Emails will only be sent to those selected to receive ‘All’ emails in step 2.</li>
								<li>Enable ‘Advanced notification settings’ to modify the email sender information of your STATCLAVE. Click Save and a ‘Remote’ Tab will appear in the menu bar.
									<h4>Setting up your STATCLAVE’s email</h4>
									<p>Your G4 is defaulted to send emails from a SciCan server. You can change the settings so it sends from a server of your choice.</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Click on the REMOTE tab to assign your unit an email address.</li>
										<li>Your STATCLAVE can use an email account set up either with your Internet service provider or with a web-based email service. Populate the email account fields on this page with your provider’s information if you are working with an email address from your Internet service provider. To use one of the STATCLAVE web portal’s preset email servers (choose from gmail, gmx mail, Yahoo and MSN mail), you must create an account for your STATCLAVE (e.g. drsmithSTATCLAVE@gmail.com).</li>
										<li>Click the Test button to verify your settings.</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li><p>Enable ‘Maintenance Notifications’ to receive email reminders of upcoming scheduled maintenance. Determine timeframe by number of cycles or number of months. Email will be sent based on whichever comes first, to those selected to receive ‘CF’ emails in step 2.</p>
									<p>
										<b>IMPORTANT: </b>‘Reset Maintenance’ button must be clicked for any changes in maintenance notification intervals to take effect.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								<b>NOTE: </b>If you are not receiving emails from your unit, check your spam filter to be certain your STATCLAVE has been identified as an accepted email source.     
							</p>
							<h4>Setting the TIME zone and Internet synchronization</h4>
							<p>Your G4 unit is capable of automatically detecting the time based on your time zone, just like your computer.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>From the SETUP page, use the TIME tab and click on the drop down menu to select your time zone. Make sure the box is checked if you want your unit to synchronize automatically with dedicated Internet time servers. It will then automatically update the time and date of your unit whenever it connects to the network. </li>
								<li>If you prefer to use the manual setup, you can select the date from the calendar and manually input the time accordingly. If you set your time manually and then decide to use the automatic time synchronization, it will override all of your manual changes.</li>
								<li>You can turn DST on or off to adjust to Daylight Savings Time. If automatic time update is disabled, this will need to be manually set.</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Setting up your PASSWORD</h4>
							<p>Set a new user name and password to keep unauthorized users from changing the configurations you have made on your web portal as well as in the Contacts information your STATCLAVE uses to generate forms.    </p>
							<ol>
								<li>From the SETUP page, go to the PASSWORD tab. Note that both the default user name and password is ‘scican’. However you can only change the password and not the user name.</li>
								<li>Enter and confirm your new password.</li>
								<li>Click Save to enable the changes.</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Setting up a BACKUP</h4>
							<p>You can create a backup file which saves all of the configurations you have done on your G4 unit. This is useful for offices that have multiple G4 units, saving you time from re-tying all the information and resetting all the configurations.</p>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<p>From the SETUP page, use the BACKUP tab and click ‘Download Settings’ create a back up file. This file contains all the configured changes such as time zones and LAN settings. It also saves all typed fields such as the Contact information and email addresses for your G4 notifications.</p>
									<p>
										<b>NOTE: </b>Use the Save As function on your computer to choose a specific location, otherwise it will load the file in a default location preset by your browser. For security reasons, all passwords will not be saved, including your setup password if that was changed in the PASSWORD tab and your G4’s email password that was set in the REMOTE tab. Neither service log nor cycle data will be backed up in this file either.
									</p>
								</li>
							</ol>
							<p>To restore settings: If you have another G4 unit, you can pre-populate all the changed settings and fields by uploading the backup file. Click Choose file and browse for the file on your computer, select it and click Restore. You will still need to go in and input the G4 email password in the REMOTE tab and re-configure the SETUP password if it was changed.</p>
							<h4>Using TOOLS</h4>
							<p>From the SETUP page, use the TOOLS tab to access the unit locally or remotely and to access the service logs. Accessing the unit locally means that you can take control of the G4 within the office network – your computer is on the same network as the G4. Accessing the unit remotely means you can take control of the G4 from anywhere in the country – your device is on a different network from the G4. You can also view and add to the unit’s service log through this menu.</p>
							<h5>Local network remote access for your STATCLAVE</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>From the TOOLS page, click on the LOCAL CONTROL tab.</li>
								<li>Click on the start button to start a local connection (within the office network). It will open up a page/tab that mirrors your STATCLAVE unit’s touchscreen. So from your web enabled device, you can click on the icons as if you were physically pushing the buttons on the touchscreen.</li>
							</ol>
							<h5>Creating a new account to enable remote access for your STATCLAVE</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>If you do not have an account you can create a new account by clicking on the New User link on the following URL: <a href="http://updates.scican.com">http://updates.scican.com</a>.</li>
								<li>Follow the instructions on the website. The system will send a confirmation email to verify your account. Once confirmed your account will be ready to use.</li>
							</ol>
							<h5>Outside network remote access for your STATCLAVE</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>From the TOOLS page, click on the REMOTE ACCESS tab.</li>
								<li>From here the end user can grant you access to their G4 unit, regardless of where you are. Once they click ‘Enable’, the server will generate a unique token that you will need to use to gain access to the unit. You can also generate a token directly from the touchscreen by going into the Information, User menu, Remote Access and Enable.</li>
								<li>You will need to go to the following URL: <a href="http://updates.scican.com">http://updates.scican.com</a> and login. If you do not have an existing account you may create a new account and then login.</li>
								<li>Once you have logged in, type in the token.</li>
								<li>Upon authentication, a page will open that mirrors your G4’s web portal. You can view the current status of the unit, previous cycle records and even take control of the unit as if you were standing in front of it. To do this, you click on TOOLS, LOCAL CONTROL and then START.</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								<b>NOTE: </b>Each remote access session will only last for 2 hours. If more time is needed, a new token will need to be generated. Also, if the token is not used with 2 hours, it will expire and a new token will need to be generated to access the unit.
							</p>
							<h5>Viewing your STATCLAVE service history and adding new entries</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>From the TOOLS page, click on the SERVICE LOG tab.</li>
								<li>You can scroll through the service log to see a history of all the maintenance done on the unit. You can email this information to all registered emails by clicking on EMAIL SERVICE LOG. To change the email list, go to the NOTIFICATIONS tab.</li>
								<li>New service entries can be added by selecting the date in the calendar and writing a brief description in the text box. Click ‘ADD NEW ENTRY’ and it will append as the top entry in the service log.</li>
							</ol>
							<h5>Testing your network</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>From the SETUP page, click on the TOOLS tab.</li>
								<li>From here you can run a simple pass or fail test to check your network connectivity. The results will confirm whether you are accessing the Internet, accessing a router and whether your unit has a proper IP address. If the last line of the feed says ‘FAILED’, please contact your network administrator.</li>
							</ol>
							<h4>Using the STATUS page</h4>
							<p>From the Status page, you can see exactly what your STATCLAVE is doing at that moment. When your unit is in operation, a graph depicting the different stages of the current cycle will display in real time. Upon completion or after a forced stop, you can print the cycle graph on a form that includes your organization’s information and logo.</p>
							<h4>Using the ARCHIVES page</h4>
							<p>From the Archives page, you can access cycle information stored in your STATCLAVE’s internal Data logger. Fill in the year, month and day fields to browse through the cycles completed on that date. To print, select the print preview button and then click Print.    </p>
							<h5>Emailing cycle information</h5>
							<p>Send the cycle information you accessed in the ARCHIVES by selecting the print preview button and clicking on EMAIL. It will send both a text file and PDF version of the cycle information to any of the email addresses you have preset in the NOTIFICATIONS page.    </p>
							<p>The STATCLAVE G4 has an internal Datalogger capable of storing all cycle data on every cycle, whether successful or incomplete, for the lifetime of the unit. You can access this information through the touchscreen, through the web portal, using a USB storage device or by attaching a printer.   </p>
							<h5>Retrieving Cycle Information using your STATCLAVE Web Portal</h5>
							<ol>
								<li>From your home page, click on the ARCHIVES page.</li>
								<li>From the ARCHIVES page, you can access cycle information stored in your STATCLAVE’s internal Datalogger. Fill in the year, month and day fields to browse through the cycles completed on that date. To print, select the print preview button and then click Print.    </li>
